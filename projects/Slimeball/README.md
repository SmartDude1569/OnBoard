# Slimeball v4 (the final iteration)

The Slimeball project has been a personal project to create a cheap SlimeVR tracker in a small form factor. (a circle 5 centimeters in diameter)
I have been working on it for about a month now, with 5 or 6 different PCB iterations and 3 total schematics.
It is similar to the [FletchVR](https://github.com/hackclub/OnBoard/blob/9d2c70aaeaf6d3fc40ac4b730c586b43462e415e/projects/FletchVR/README.md) project that was also submitted to OnBoard, but the difference is that the Slimeball is a full board with all the components, and FletchVR is a carrier board that allows breakout boards to communicate. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
